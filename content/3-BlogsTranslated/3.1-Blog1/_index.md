# **The rise of autonomous agents: What enterprise leaders need to know about the next wave of AI**

**![](/images/3-Translated-Blogs/3.1-Blog1/1.png)**

Autonomous AI agents represent the next significant evolution in artificial intelligence, moving beyond conversational interfaces to systems that leverage AI to reason, plan, and complete tasks in tandem with – or on behalf of humans – like compiling research, paying bills, planning a trip or managing enterprise applications.

Use of autonomous agents is rapidly maturing and reaching a tipping point in enterprise adoption, enabled by cost effective foundational models with advanced reasoning capabilities, secure data infrastructure, and emergence of development tools. Enterprise leaders face tremendous opportunities and significant organizational challenges as these AI agents transition from experimental technology to core business infrastructure.

### **Understanding autonomous AI agents: beyond simple automation**

Just like autonomous driving has progressed from Level 1 (cruise control) to Level 4 (full autonomy in specific domains), the level of agency of AI agents is growing.

**Level 1 – Chain:** Rule-based robotic process automation (RPA) where both actions and their sequence are pre-defined. Example: Extracting invoice data from PDFs and entering it into a database.

**Level 2 – Workflow:** Actions are pre-defined, but the sequence can be dynamically determined using routers or Large Language Models (LLMs). Example: Drafting customer emails or running Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with branching logic.

**Level 3 – Partially autonomous** Given a goal, the agent can plan, execute, and adjust a sequence of actions using a domain-specific toolkit, with minimal human oversight. Example: Resolving customer support tickets across multiple systems.

**Level 4 – Fully autonomous:** Operates with little to no oversight across domains, proactively sets goals, adapts to outcomes, and may even create or select its own tools. Example: Strategic research agents that discover, summarize, and synthesize information independently.

As of Q1 2025, most agentic AI applications (AI systems that can act autonomously) remain at Level 1 and 2, with a few exploring Level 3 within narrow domains and a limited number of tools (generally under 30). What distinguishes truly autonomous agents is their capacity to reason iteratively, evaluate outcomes, adapt plans, and pursue goals without ongoing human input.


### **Economic Impact: Market Forecast and Business Transformation**

Based on [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier), generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) will contribute between 2.6 and 4.4 billion US dollars per year to global GDP. This is becoming a reality thanks to the use of automated agents, with [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/intelligent-agent-in-ai) forecasting that at least 15% of work decisions will be made automatically by AI agents by 2028, compared to 0% in 2024. The AI ​​agent market itself is expected to [reach $52.6 billion](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADxY7SzIPN P1hoRzTlxwgvEWX-gBz&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_JzABhC2ARIsAPe3ynrmv6gaz5kYEVUU53zfXP8Gc1nWppnfsJ93QCjcAmQbNW3BZHb-9qAaAklmEALw_wcB) by 2030, a CAGR of around 45%.

All these numbers reflect not only a level of enthusiasm but also a growing belief among businesses in the practical possibilities of agent-based AI. Organizations are showing significant interest in agent AI, with [more than 50%](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone3/us/en/docs/services/consulting/2024/us-state-of-gen-ai-q4.pdf) organizations identifying it as a priority area for biological AI development. While there is some skepticism that the literature here is just a passing trend, the evidence for this level of maturity is solid. Companies are moving beyond the pilot phase and developing these solutions into real operations, achieving tangible benefits in three key areas: improving productivity, reducing costs, and accelerating innovation cycles. For example:

**Innovation and Research Agents:** [Genentech](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/genentech-generativeai-case-study/), a US-based biotechnology company, built an agent solution on AWS that automates the time-consuming process of public research, allowing their scientists to focus on high-impact research and new Transformation. The system uses automated agents that can break down complex research tasks into dynamic, multi-step workflows. Unlike traditional automation systems that incorporate predefined paths, these agents adapt their approaches based on information gathered at each step, access and analyze multiple architectural bases using RAG, and execute complex queries by interacting with Genentech's APIs and internal databases. This agent solution will help Genentech automate much of the manual work required to validate biomarkers across therapeutic areas, reducing time to target identification and accelerating innovation.

**Workplace Productivity Agent:** Amazon has accelerated developer productivity to modernize legacy applications by developing employees using [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/). One of the most powerful capabilities of Amazon Q Developer is the automation of Java version upgrades to convert Java applications. In 2024, Amazon integrated Java conversion capabilities into Amazon’s internal systems and migrated the aerodynamics production product from older Java versions 8 or 11 to Java 17. This effort allows developers to complete these upgrades simultaneously in a fraction of the time, while delivering performance improvements and cost savings across Amazon.

**Business Process Agent:** US-based [Rocket Mortgage](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/enabling-complex-generative-ai-applications-with-amazon-bedrock-agents/) needed a more personalized and efficient approach to navigating home owners. Rocket developed an AI-powered support system using Amazon Bedrock Agents, creating an information platform that aggregates 10 petabytes of master data and delivers tailored publisher issues and accurate, real-time personalized financial guidance. The result is faster problem resolution, improved personalization accuracy, and an enhanced customer experience in navigating the complex home finance process.

### **Tool or Teammate? The Future of Human-AI Collaboration**

Beyond economic forecasts, automated agents represent a profound shift in how work is structured and value is created. At the heart of this change is the emergence of “human-AI partnerships”—redefining the concept of “human in the loop.” Both humans and agents are capable of generating ideas, making decisions, and adapting to new data, but in radically different ways. Humans bring life experience, moral reasoning, and intuitive creativity—often relying on emotion and ambiguity. Agents, by contrast, excel at tireless execution, statistical pattern recognition, and achieving goals at scale.

The question then becomes: Are automated agents merely tools, or are they evolving into teammates? One could argue that agents remain tools, lacking consciousness, intentionality, or moral responsibility. Functionally, however, their ability to act autonomously, maintain sustainable goals, and coordinate with other agents opens up a new operating reality where they behave as teammates. While agents themselves lack moral agency, the consequences of their actions often exhibit moral behavior—behavior shaped by human architects who design their goals, constraints, and moral barriers. The key question we need to ponder: Where do humans still contribute irreplaceable value to cognitive tasks? The answer will increasingly depend on context. In high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal interpretation, or policymaking—human judgment, empathy, and moral reasoning remain indispensable. In domains like logistics or IT automation—monitoring, exception handling, and system design will still rely heavily on human expertise.

We will see a rebalancing of roles, with humans focused on overseeing complex workflows, shaping goals, and ensuring accountable outcomes. Skills development will become essential as success in the workplace increasingly depends on agent knowledge – the ability to oversee, collaborate, and strategically direct teams of agents, much like working with human teammates today. While this may lead to the emergence of some new roles, particularly in AI governance, it will often involve the evolution of existing roles. For example, customer support team leaders may oversee multi-agent service systems, and business analysts may also be the ones evaluating AI results. The challenge for businesses is to build the systems, policies, and cultures where this new form of collaboration can thrive. ### **Ethics in the World of Autonomous Agents**

Successful adoption of autonomous agents requires a focus on governance and ethics. As AI agents take on more decision-making responsibilities, organizations must develop clear ethical guidelines—especially in areas involving sensitive customer, financial, or operational data. What really matters is the expectation gap: Users often demand perfection from technology, in this case AI agents, while accepting imperfection in humans. This high standard for AI agents can erode trust even when agents make errors at a much smaller scale than humans. [Explainability](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0363) and interpretation are key to closing this gap. Humans are more likely to accept an AI decision if it is accompanied by an explanation that mimics human reasoning and ethical principles.

Two important factors here are **accountability** and **privacy**, as the level of autonomy increases.

**Responsibility** (who is responsible): As agents evolve from tools to teammates, the concept of responsibility evolves—not eliminated, but reallocated (we would never say that an AI agent is “responsible”). Enterprises need a framework of shared responsibility, where each party is responsible for the part of the system they control. As agents’ autonomy increases, this “accountability mix” becomes more important—and must be clearly defined and documented, such as through a Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) matrix or governance policy. For example:

* ML engineers are responsible for ensuring the model is fine-tuned with objective data
* Development and MLOps teams are responsible for establishing correct data access and integrating safeguards
* Product owners and business teams are responsible for approving the solution after thorough testing

Traceability will be key to ensuring root cause analysis when an agent fails
