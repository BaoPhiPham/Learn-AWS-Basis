### [Blog 1 - The rise of autonomous agents: What enterprise leaders need to know about the next wave of AI](3.1-Blog1/)

Autonomous AI agents represent the next significant evolution in artificial intelligence, moving beyond conversational interfaces to systems that leverage AI to reason, plan, and complete tasks in tandem with – or on behalf of humans – like compiling research, paying bills, planning a trip or managing enterprise applications.Use of autonomous agents is rapidly maturing and reaching a tipping point in enterprise adoption, enabled by cost effective foundational models with advanced reasoning capabilities, secure data infrastructure, and emergence of development tools. Enterprise leaders face tremendous opportunities and significant organizational challenges as these AI agents transition from experimental technology to core business infrastructure.

### [Blog 2 - Host persistent world games on Amazon GameLift Servers](3.2-Blog2/)

Multiplayer games have evolved from pure session-based and traditional massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) to newer online experiences that combine persistent and session-based elements. Games such as Destiny 2 and Rust are great examples of this. The persistent gameplay can be “hubs” or “home worlds” that players wander in and interact with, then launch into session-based experiences. These games can allow players to create new persistent worlds and log in and out as they please. Supporting this new wave of multiplayer experiences necessitates flexible technology, both for game session management and game world data persistence.

### [Blog 3 - Build real-time conversational AI experiences using Amazon Nova Sonic and LiveKit](3.3-Blog3/)

The rapid growth of generative AI technology has been a catalyst for business productivity growth, creating new opportunities for greater efficiency, enhanced customer service experiences, and more successful customer outcomes. Today’s generative AI advances are helping existing technologies achieve their long-promised potential. For example, voice-first applications have been gaining traction across industries for years—from customer service to education to personal voice assistants and agents. But early versions of this technology struggled to interpret human speech or mimic real conversation. Building real-time, natural-sounding, low-latency voice AI has until recently remained complex, especially when working with streaming infrastructure and speech foundation models (FMs).
